## 1. Summary
minikube does not properly sanitize file names before using them in dynamically generated commands, allowing attackers to exploit this flaw for command injection inside the Kubernetes cluster container during its creation process.


## 2. Details
minikube creates a container on the host machine that acts as a Kubernetes cluster (Pod containers are created inside this cluster container). It contains a feature to trust CA PEM files, to enable it to run on proxy environments with TLS inspection. The file names of these PEM files are used inside commands and are not escaped correctly.


## 3. Workaround and Fix
The following chapter describes how the reported vulnerability can be mitigated (e.g., using a workaround) and if available sustainably fixed.
### Workaround
Ensure that attackers cannot create/rename files on the host system and trigger a cluster container recreation.


### Fix
All commands containing user-supplied data must be properly neutralized for the target context, usually through output encoding.
Version 1.38.0 fixes this vulnerability.
